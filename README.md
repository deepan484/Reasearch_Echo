# Research Echopedia üé§üìö

**Transforming IEEE-format Research Papers into Concise, Portable Audio Summaries**

---

## üìñ Overview

The **Research Echopedia** project enhances the accessibility of IEEE-format research papers by converting their dense technical content into concise, portable audio summaries. This system uses a three-stage pipeline:  
1. **Text Extraction** with **pdfplumber**
2. **Summarization** with **AWS Bedrock's LLaMA model**
3. **Audio Conversion** using **Amazon Polly**

The downloadable audio outputs provide a flexible and engaging way to consume academic content on the go. By integrating advanced technologies, this solution bridges the gap in academic dissemination.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Input and Parsing**  
The system accepts IEEE-format PDF papers, extracting text from both columns using **pdfplumber**.

- **Input Format Handling**: Supports PDF files, typical in academic dissemination.
- **Text Extraction**: Using pdfplumber to handle complex layouts with two columns, ensuring accurate content capture.
- **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, normalization, and segmentation for effective summarization.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Summarization**  
The preprocessed text is fed into **AWS Bedrock‚Äôs LLaMA model** to generate clear and concise summaries of the research paper.

- **Model Selection**: AWS LLaMA model optimized for academic summarization.
- **Summarization Process**: The text is formatted to generate a precise summary, retaining key insights.
  
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Audio Conversion**  
**Amazon Polly** is used to convert the summarized text into natural-sounding speech.

- **Audio Generation**: High-quality MP3 audio compatible across devices.
- **Audio Enhancement**: Volume normalization and trimming for improved listening experience.
- **Downloadable Audio**: Users can download the MP3 audio for offline access.
